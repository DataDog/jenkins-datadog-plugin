<div>
    <p>Read a file from workspace as a newline seperated list of tags to push to DataDog. Location is relative to workspace.</p>
    <p>Example: <em>os=${OS_PARAM}</em>.</p> 
    <p>The value can either be something that is automatically expanded by Jenkins (environment and/or build variable), or a static value. The OS_PARAM in this case is expanded by Jenkins.</p>
