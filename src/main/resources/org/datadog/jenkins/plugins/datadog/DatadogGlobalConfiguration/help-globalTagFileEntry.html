<div>
    <p>Read a file from workspace as a newline separated list of tags to push to Datadog. Location is relative to workspace.</p>
    <p>Example: <em>os=${OS_PARAM}</em>.</p>
    <p>The value can either be something that is automatically expanded by Jenkins (environment and/or build variable), or a static value. The OS_PARAM in this case is expanded by Jenkins.</p>
    <p><em>Note:</em> Tags set this way, in the workspace, won't appear in started events. To provide visibility of a jobs lifespan, check the option for sending an extra event after each successful checkout.</p>
